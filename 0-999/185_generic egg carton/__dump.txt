Sturdy enough to carry in one hand, the two sculpted knobs of protruding fibre on its base fit ingeniously into the pre-punched holes of its lid to secure a seal, the carton is pledged to fulfill its modest function and then -- duty performed, eggs eaten -- is prepared to be recycled, composted or repurposed for crafts, or used to soundproof a pervious wall. Such unassuming perfection in design is one of the quiet reliable pleasures of the whole messy human experience."}
